    <div class="panel">
        Git Fetch <hr>
        It downloads only new data from a remote repository using Git fetch
        It does not include any of this new information in your working files
        To update the remote-tracking branches, run Git fetch at any time
        Command - git fetch origin
                      git fetch â€“-all
        
       <hr> Git Pull <hr>
        Git pulls new data and integrates it with the current working files, updating the current HEAD branch with the latest modifications from the remote server
        It attempts to combine remote modifications with those made locally
        Command - git pull origin master
